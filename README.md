# Ticketing Service

## Assumptions:
Multi-event booking support available.

DB(H2) is pre-populated with minimal data for one event for running integration tests. 

For every new event, a db script will be run to pre-populate db(seat_hold table) with available seats. No separate
count is maintained for keeping track of total seats.

No payment option implemented.

Service decides which best seat to reserve depending on the availability, no choice given to the user.
Customer details are not maintained in the system except for customer email.

## How to run the application

Stand-alone mode: mvn spring-boot:run
